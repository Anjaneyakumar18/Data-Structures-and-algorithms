learn oops basics mainly (class,objects,constructors,instance members,stactic members ....)

Learn stcak fundamentals
push()
pop()
top()
isEmpty()

mostly deals with array and string problems 


For all the problems whose brute force is O(n**2) and the Brute Force algo is like


for i=0 to n{          #ith loop
    for j=0 to i{      #jth loop
        statements
    }
}


->the internal loop(j-th loop) is dependent on the itarative variable of external loop (i-th loop)
  then you can use stack to get optimal solution
