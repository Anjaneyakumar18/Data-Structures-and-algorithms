For all the problems whose brute force is O(n**2) and the Brute Force algo is like
for i in 0 to n{
    for j in o to i{
        statements
    }
}
->the internal loop(j-th loop) is dependent on the itarative variable of external loop (i-th loop)
  then you can use stack to get optimal solution
